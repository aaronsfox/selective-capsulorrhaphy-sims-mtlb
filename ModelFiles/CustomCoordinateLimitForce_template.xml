		<!--Flag indicating whether the force is applied or not. If true the forceis applied to the MultibodySystem otherwise the force is not applied.NOTE: Prior to OpenSim 4.0, this behavior was controlled by the 'isDisabled' property, where 'true' meant that force was not being applied. Thus, if 'isDisabled' is true, then 'appliesForce` is false.-->
