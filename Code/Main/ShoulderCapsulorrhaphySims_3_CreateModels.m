%% Goal of this function is to create the models with the optimised 
%  parameters and visualise some curves that represent the ligament forces
%
%  Consider plotting the total ligament function force versus the relevant
%  joint angle. Consider plotting joint angle on the x-axis and only
%  plotting the function value to the joint angle that is achieved via the
%  separate plications. Theoretically we should see shorter but steeper
%  curves for plications...
